            The Snap version of GitHub Desktop needs to be upgraded manually as
            migrating from using the <Ref>strict</Ref> enclosure to the{' '}
            <Ref>classic</Ref> enclosure requires your consent. You will need to
            run these commands to upgrade manually to the beta channel which has
            the change of confinement.

          <pre className="commands">{commands}</pre>
          <p>
            As this channel will not be getting any further updates while we
            perform this transition,{' '}
            <strong>we recomend upgrading as soon as possible</strong> to get
            the latest Desktop builds.
